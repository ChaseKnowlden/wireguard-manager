# wireguard-manager

WireGuard administration and user management. Developed weekly live at [The Alt-F4 Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/thealtf4stream "The Alt-F4 Stream") on Twitch.

## Purpose

At the time of creating, there was no already largely used WireGuard admin tools that allowed you to maintain configuration state AND provide downloadable configurations to clients via some kind of central location.

This project is aimed to solve that probem.
